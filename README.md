A repository that helps set up Nomad, Consul, Vault, Docker, traefik for a home lab.


# Nomad
 The script is pretty straightforward. It asks the user for the installation type (server, client, or both), then installs Nomad based on the user‚Äôs choice. 
 The script also creates the configuration file for Nomad based on the user‚Äôs choice. 
 The script then starts the Nomad service and prints out some useful information.
